why vim?

    # slide with a lot of editors/IDEs

    file-configurable

    # lots are drawn out

    open source

    # more are drawn out

    awesome

    # vim is left

there was a bit of irony on last slide.

this talk is not about starting a flame war!

actually, others are awesome too.

# back in all other again.


this talk is about a modern vim setup.

using tools, which can be used in other editors too.

which help you write better code.

i just have a focus on vim.


vim has a long history, which dates back to the beginnings of unix.

most programmers have used vi or vim once in a while.
sometimes being forced to.

most setups are horrible.
even i have a talk about vim, i cannot use a standard vim setup.
i have a hard time trying to edit a file.

but with the right setup, it's going to be really efficient.

the best way to learn vim is to learn it's commands.
but you haven't to.
i just know and use a fraction of them.
i love to configure everything the way i'm able to work with.

let's have a look into a basic vim setup!
